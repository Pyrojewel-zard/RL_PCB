# Git Workflow Guidelines

## Branch Management
- **Main branch is sacred**: Never push directly to `main`
- Use feature branches: `git checkout -b your-name/feature-description`
- Follow the workflow in [DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md](mdc:DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md)

## Commit Messages
Use conventional commit format:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code formatting
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test additions/changes

## Pull Request Process
1. Create feature branch from latest `main`
2. Make frequent, small commits
3. Rebase with `main` regularly: `git rebase origin/main`
4. Create PR with clear description
5. Request code review
6. Use "Squash and Merge" when approved

## Code Review Standards
- Review for logic correctness
- Check code style and documentation
- Ensure tests are included
- Verify experiment reproducibility

## Before Merging
- All tests must pass
- Code review approved
- Documentation updated
- Experiment results validated
